  @Preconditions
    None

  @Param
    None

  @Returns
    None

  @Summary
    Set Input data into DAC3.

  @Description
    This routine pass the digital input data into
    DAC3 voltage reference control register.

  @Preconditions
    The DAC3_Initialize() routine should be called
    prior to use this routine.

  @Param
    inputData - 8bit digital data to DAC3.

  @Returns
    None
